# TP DevOps Correction Docker

Correction de la partie Docker du module DevOps. Amusez-vous bien avec GitHub Actions !

This file is now the posession of the great Fran√ßois Thievon !!!

QUESTIONS :  

2-1 What are testcontainers ?  
Testcontainers is a Java library which allows Docker containers in our automate test. It allows you to test services like a Postgres DB in our example  

2-2 For what purpose do we need to use secured variables ?  
Secured Variables are used to protect informations like credentials in our workflows  

2-3 Why did we put needs: build-and-test-backend on this job ? Maybe try without this and you will see !  
We put needs for this jon because there is a dependance of the build and push with the test backend. The build and push will publish images only if the test wackend is completed.It allows to publish images only if the quality code is sufficient and the compilation passed good**CD is the next logigal step of CI**  

2-4 For what purpose do we need to push docker images ?  
Pushing a Docker image makes the application easily deployable and shareable across environments without rebuilding.It enables versioning, supports Continuous Delivery, and is essential for deployment automation.  

3-1 Document your inventory and base commands  
Done  

3-2 Document your playbook  
Done  

3-3 Document your docker_container tasks configuration  
Done  

## Now, each time we push a change on the code, github actions will :
  - 1st action : Check that the code is ready to run and qualitative with SonarCloud
  - 2nd action : Build the images with Dockerfile and push them on dockerhub
  - 3rd action : Pull the images from dockerhub and create the containers on my personal takima server in order to run the web page  
Everything works perfectly ! If we destroy the server, we just need to push anything for the actions to run again and create the site again !
